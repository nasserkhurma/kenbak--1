the Kenbak-1 was a true stored-program computer that offered 256 bytes of memory, a wide variety of operations and a speed equivalent to nearly 1MHz.The Kenbak-1 was designed before the first microprocessor, hence its sole basis was small-scale integration TTL chips rather than a single chip for the CPU. The 8-bit computer used Intel's type 1404A silicon gate MOS shift registers to implement its 256 bytes of memory.
Designed in 1971, before microprocessors were invented, the Kenbak-1 had 256 bytes of memory and featured small and medium scale integrated circuits on a single circuit board. 
Since the Kenbak-1 was invented before the first microprocessor, the machine didn't have a one-chip CPU but was instead based purely on small-scale integration TTL chips.
